Hi, I’d like to confirm the full list of features that still need to be implemented directly inside the Replit project files. These updates must be visible and functional in the app interface — especially in the dog details and edit pages. Here’s a complete summary of what needs to be added:

1. Microchip Information
	•	Fields to add to the Dog model:
	•	microchip_number (string)
	•	microchip_date (date)
	•	microchip_inserted (boolean: True if inserted)
	•	Where to show/edit:
	•	Display on the dog detail page
	•	Editable in the edit dog page
	•	Show status like: “Microchip inserted on 2024-12-05” or “Not inserted”

2. Vaccination Records
	•	Create a new Vaccination model linked to each dog:
	•	vaccine_type (string)
	•	vaccine_date (date)
	•	notes (optional text)
	•	Relationship: One-to-many (each dog can have multiple vaccinations)
	•	Full CRUD:
	•	Add, Edit, Delete vaccinations from the dog detail page
	•	Display vaccination history as a list or table under each dog
	•	Vaccination data must be saved in the database and persist between sessions

3. Sale Status
	•	Add to Dog model:
	•	is_sold (boolean)
	•	Show on dog detail and allow editing in the edit page
	•	Example: “Status: Sold” or “Status: Available”

4. Date of Birth and Automatic Age
	•	Add birth_date (date) to Dog model
	•	Display calculated age (in years and months) on dog detail page
	•	Example: “Born on 2022-06-15 (2 years, 3 months old)”
	•	Make birth_date editable in the edit page

⸻

General Implementation Notes:
	•	Please update models.py to include all the new fields and relationships
	•	Make sure routes.py supports saving, updating, and deleting all new data
	•	Update edit.html and detail.html templates to include:
	•	Editable fields for microchip, birth date, sale status
	•	Vaccination section with form and vaccination list
	•	All changes should match the existing design and layout style
	•	Everything must be fully integrated into the live app and saved in the persistent database

Let me know if you need example inputs or specific layout preferences.

Thanks!
